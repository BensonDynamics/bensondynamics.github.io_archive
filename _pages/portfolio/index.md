# Some examples of my course work, mid-masters:

## On electric aerospace and superconducting motors:

## Optimization as a method for linkage design:

<embed src = /docs/523link.pdf type = "application/pdf">

## Optimization of a Flying Wing's Geometry

<embed src = /docs/523proj.pdf type = "application/pdf">

## Analysis of a 10 Bar Truss Using a Stiffness Matrix 

This needs a little more introduction. The analysis used below resembles an FEA analysis, however it was computed by hand. The problem had a mesh provided, eliminating the most mathematically interesting part of an FEA process.
